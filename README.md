The mod is inspired by the TZP Inhalant item that you can buy in the game. It gives a speed and stamina buff, but also increases the voice pitch of the player who used it!
I thought, why don't we have custom pitches?
This mod allows you to change player voices (using the config file), and the default is a higher pitch.
First attempt at modding Lethal Company!
